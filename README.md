# Cooperative Frameworks post-COVID19 2020-08-13

## Overview

[This repository](https://github.com/peterkaminski/transcript-Cooperative-Frameworks-post-COVID19-2020-08-13) contains a transcript of the Foresight Institute Weekly Salon of August 13, 2020, [Sensemaking: Cooperative Frameworks post-COVID19 & Cross-Silo Cooperation](https://www.facebook.com/events/901430270378723/).  You can watch the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qNEDoYYLUY), and read a [machine-generated transcript](https://otter.ai/s/wHFNUJLyTniIetIidPt5fA).  The files in this repository have a [human-corrected transcript](https://github.com/peterkaminski/transcript-Cooperative-Frameworks-post-COVID19-2020-08-13/blob/master/Cooperative%20Frameworks%20post-COVID19%202020-08-13.md), which better reflects the speakers’ words.

The featured speakers were **Phoebe Tickell** and **Dave Snowden**.  The host was **Lou de Kerhuelvez**.  Dave replaced Nora Bateson at the last minute.

The transcript included here was created primarily by Peter Kaminski, by starting with a machine-generated transcript of the recorded Zoom call, then carefully editing the material to correct machine transcription mistakes.  Filler words, fragments, and small repetitions by the speakers were also removed, with the intent of preserving the full meaning of the speech.

In some cases, words were hard to distinguish due to audio quality, and inevitably there may be mistakes in transcription.  Please confirm exact wording with the recording and with the speakers before any critical use.

## Files and Text Conventions

### Text Conventions

There is a timestamp in parentheses at the beginning of each paragraph of text.  The timestamps are approximate.

When the speaker changes, the speaker’s first name is included in square brackets. In subsequent paragraphs, the speaker name is left off.

Paragraph breaks were made with some intention to group the sentences for meaning, but sometimes they were just placed to aid in the process of transcription.  Paragraph breaks aren’t always perfectly placed.

When a word was not understood, “(sp?)” (short for “spelling?”) is added either after a possible word, or in replacement of the unclear word.

Three dots (…) are used sometimes when a speaker’s sentence trails off.  Three dots are also used in a few places where the audio was unclear, usually because more than one person was speaking.

**Bold** formatting is used when the speaker emphasized a word.
